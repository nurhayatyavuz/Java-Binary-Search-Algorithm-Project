# Java Binary Search Algorithm Project

This project includes an implementation of the binary search algorithm in the Java programming language. Binary search is a powerful algorithm used to efficiently find a specific value in a sorted array.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how the binary search algorithm works and provide a practical example of how it can be implemented in Java. This project aims to help students, novice developers, and anyone who wants to learn algorithms understand binary search better.

## Algorithm Explanation

Binary search is an algorithm used to search in a sorted array. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Check the middle element of the array.

2. If the searched value is equal to the middle element, the search is complete.

3. If the searched value is less than the middle element, continue searching in the left half of the array.

4. If the searched value is greater than the middle element, continue searching in the right half of the array.

5. Repeat these steps until the search range is empty.
